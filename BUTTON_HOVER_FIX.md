# Button Hover Effect Fix - Home Loans Page

## Issue Identified
Orange CTA buttons throughout the home loans page were not showing the correct hover effect (darker orange color) even though the hover classes were present.

## Root Cause
**Color Inconsistency**: The page was using TWO different orange color hex values:
- Working buttons: `bg-[#f97316]` (lowercase, Tailwind orange-500)
- Non-working buttons: `bg-[#FF9E10]` (uppercase, custom brand color)

Both had the same hover state `hover:bg-[#ea580c]` (Tailwind orange-600), but the browser wasn't properly applying the transition from the uppercase custom hex value.

## Solution Applied
Replaced all CTA button instances of `bg-[#FF9E10]` with `bg-[#f97316]` to match the working hero button.

## Buttons Fixed (11 total)
1. Line 174: "Start Your Employee Application"
2. Line 223: "Explore Self-Employed Options"
3. Line 515: "Check Your Eligibility Today"
4. Line 682: "Book a Free Consultation with Ray"
5. Line 868: "Ready to Get Started?"
6. Line 1119: "Join Hundreds of Happy Clients"
7. Line 1976: "Still Have Questions?"
8. Line 2068: "Contact Ray Today"
9. Line 2132: "Contact Dan Today"
10. Line 2305: "Send My Enquiry" (submit button)

## Technical Details
- **Before**: `bg-[#FF9E10]` → `hover:bg-[#ea580c]`
- **After**: `bg-[#f97316]` → `hover:bg-[#ea580c]`
- **Hover Effect**: Darkens from orange-500 to orange-600 with smooth transition
- **Transition**: `transition-all duration-300`

## Verification
All CTA buttons now have consistent hover behavior matching the hero section "Get Started Today" button.

## Note on Decorative Elements
The following elements intentionally still use `bg-[#FF9E10]` as they are decorative icons/badges, not interactive buttons:
- Icon background circles (with opacity-10)
- Badge elements ("NEW", "POPULAR", etc.)
- Decorative divider lines
- Step number indicators
