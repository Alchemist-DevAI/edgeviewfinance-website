# Service Cards Button Text Color Fix

## Issue
The buttons at the bottom of service cards had orange text on orange background, making them unreadable:
- "Purchase Equipment" button
- "Fix Cash Flow" button
- "Buy Commercial Property" button

## Root Cause
The button styling was using an orange color that matched the background, creating a contrast issue where text was not visible.

## Solution Applied
Updated the ServicesSection.astro component to ensure proper button styling:

### Before (PROBLEMATIC):
```css
/* Text color was orange, same as background */
class="... text-orange-500 bg-orange-500 ..."
```

### After (FIXED):
```css
/* Text color is now white, background remains orange */
class="... text-white bg-orange-500 hover:bg-orange-600 ..."
```

## Files Modified
- `/src/components/IndexPage/ServicesSection.astro` - Main component fix
- Button styling specifically changed from orange text to white text

## CSS Classes Applied
```css
class="inline-flex w-full justify-center items-center px-6 py-3 bg-orange-500 hover:bg-orange-600 text-white font-semibold rounded-lg transition-colors duration-300 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-orange-500 focus:ring-offset-2 focus:ring-offset-gray-900"
```

## Verification
- ✅ White text on orange background = HIGH CONTRAST
- ✅ Buttons are now fully readable
- ✅ Maintains brand orange color (#FF9E10)
- ✅ Hover effects work properly
- ✅ Accessibility improved
