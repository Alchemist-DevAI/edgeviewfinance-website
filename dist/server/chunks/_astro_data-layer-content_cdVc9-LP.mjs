It's a narrative woven with ambition, challenges, successes, and dreams. Much like a captivating novel, your business's journey has unique characters, pivotal moments, and an overarching plot that grabs attention and compels action. But have you ever thought about what story your business is telling?\r\n\r\nIf your business relies on bank finance to fuel its growth, then the narrative you present to a lender matters. Many businesses face challenges and frustrations when trying to obtain finance, and often, this can be attributed to the story their financials tell.\r\n\r\nWhat journey are you taking lenders on? How would your business's narrative unfold in their eyes? Let's explore how the fundamentals of commercial finance align perfectly with the elements of storytelling and how your business's story can significantly impact your ability to secure finance.\r\n\r\n## A Captivating Beginning: Setting the Scene\r\n\r\nIn every great story, the beginning sets the stage, introducing the protagonist and the world they inhabit. For your business, this is where you present your background and history – the origin story.\r\n\r\nYour business's credit history, mission, vision, and the market environment are crucial. Lenders need to understand the context of your business: What inspired its inception? What unique value does it bring to the market? Like a gripping novel, the opening should be engaging and informative, drawing the reader (lender) into your world.\r\n\r\n## The Protagonist: Your Business's Financial Health\r\n\r\nThe hero of your business story is undoubtedly your company itself, with its financial health being the core character trait. Financial statements – your balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement – are not just numbers; they reflect your business's strength, stability, and potential. \r\n\r\nThese elements are akin to the hero's attributes in a novel, showcasing resilience and capability. A robust financial health indicates a protagonist ready to take on challenges, instilling confidence in the reader (lender).\r\n\r\n## Supporting Characters: Key Financial Metrics\r\n\r\nEvery hero needs a guide, and in commercial finance, this is your commercial finance broker. They help the hero uncover strengths, unlock potential, overcome obstacles, and chart a course towards success, navigating the opaque business banking credit guidelines. No story is complete without its supporting characters, and in commercial finance, these are your key financial metrics. \r\n\r\nLiquidity ratios, debt-to-equity ratios, and profitability metrics each play a role in defining the narrative. They add depth and dimension to your business story, demonstrating how well your company manages its resources and obligations. These metrics support your protagonist, highlighting strengths and addressing weaknesses, which are essential for a lender to understand your business's full story.\r\n\r\n## The Plot: Business Strategy, Goals, and Opportunities\r\n\r\nThe plot of your business story revolves around your business strategy, goals, and opportunities for the future. This is where the action unfolds. Your strategy outlines your goals and the path you intend to take to achieve them. This plot must be clear, logical, and compelling for a lender. It should address market opportunities, competitive advantages, and potential risks. \r\n\r\nJust as a novel's plot keeps readers hooked, your strategy should captivate lenders, showing them a clear and promising path forward. Finance becomes the critical ingredient to capture these opportunities, presenting a picture of low risk and growth for the future.\r\n\r\n## Conflict and Resolution: Addressing Financial Needs\r\n\r\nEvery great story has conflict – obstacles the protagonist must overcome. In your business narrative are the financial gaps, opportunities, and challenges you face. Whether it's funding for expansion, overcoming cash flow issues, or investing in new assets, inventory, or technology, these conflicts are crucial plot points. The resolution comes in the form of the financial solutions you propose. \r\n\r\nHere, your commercial finance broker becomes the narrator, your voice and advocate. They help articulate how commercial finance will bridge these gaps and propel your business forward, akin to the hero overcoming trials to achieve victory. This is the climax of your story, where the lender sees the value and potential of their investment.\r\n\r\n## The Denouement: Culminating the Financial Narrative\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of your story should leave the reader (lender) with a sense of satisfaction and anticipation. Instead of focusing on future projections, consider the culmination of your financial data and history coming to life to tell the story of capturing future opportunities and executing strategic objectives. The lender becomes part of your business's success story, reinforcing the potential for growth and stability.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion: Crafting a Compelling Business Narrative\r\n\r\nBy framing your business in the context of storytelling, you can create a more engaging and persuasive narrative for lenders. Every financial statement, metric, and strategic decision contributes to a richer, more compelling story. Remember, your business is the hero, and the journey to secure commercial finance is the plot that will lead to triumph.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding and ensuring that your business tells the best possible story is crucial; this is where a commercial finance broker becomes invaluable. At Edgeview Finance, we are your narrators, translating your business's financials into a language lenders understand and can support. If you want to explore the story your financials and business are telling, reach out to Edgeview Finance.

Designers create solutions (typically applications) to meet mobile users' unique requirements and restrictions. Designers focus on accessibility, discoverability\nand efficiency to optimize on-the-go interactive experiences.\n\nInterface (UI) determines how the app will look like, while UX determines what problem it will solve in the users' life. UI is revolves around visually directing the user about the app interface, while UX includes researching, testing, developing the app.\n\n##### What we did for this project\n\nA user can engage with a product or service by using a user interface (UI), which is essentially a collection of screens, pages, visual elements (such as buttons and icons). The phrase “User Experience” refers to how a person reacts to each component.\n\n<ol class='list-inside list-decimal my-5'>\n  <li>Strategic Discovery</li>\n  <li>Web application redesign and optimization</li>\n  <li>Mobile application redesign and optimization</li>\n  <li>Landing page redesign and optimization</li>\n  <li>Component-based UI-Kit</li>\n  <li>Product design sprints to explore new functionality</li>\n</ol>\n\n![portfolio image](/assets/img/th-1/portfolio-inner-img.jpg)\n\n##### Project results\n\nThe UI/UX design of software and applications helps improve customer experience and satisfaction. This ultimately helps increase the number of people using your product. If users encounter roadblocks when trying to complete actions on your product, they are very likely to drop off.\n\nCreating a brand with clear and targeted messaging was crucial in increasing conversions. Together with the Webflow team, we have compiled a new product page structure using the App model and packed that in an excellent cover 🙂","src/content/portfolio/portfolio-2.mdx","379b8b41affd4515","portfolio-2.mdx","portfolio-1",{id:252,data:254,body:248,filePath:260,digest:261,legacyId:262,deferredRender:22},{title:255,image:256,type:257,category:258,client:244,duration:259,websiteLink:246,shortDescription:247},"The power of Communication","/assets/img/th-1/portfolio-img-1.jpg","App","UI/UX Design","1 Month","src/content/portfolio/portfolio-1.mdx","0274344f1108c1cc","portfolio-1.mdx","portfolio-3",{id:263,data:265,body:248,filePath:269,digest:270,legacyId:271,deferredRender:22},{title:266,image:267,type:268,category:258,client:244,duration:245,websiteLink:246,shortDescription:247},"Social Media","/assets/img/th-1/portfolio-img-3.jpg","Campaign","src/content/portfolio/portfolio-3.mdx","8e45c8eb9b019377","portfolio-3.mdx","portfolio-4",{id:272,data:274,body:248,filePath:279,digest:280,legacyId:281,deferredRender:22},{title:275,image:276,type:277,category:243,client:244,duration:278,websiteLink:246,shortDescription:247},"Moises Caestro","/assets/img/th-1/portfolio-img-4.jpg","Journal","1.5 Week","src/content/portfolio/portfolio-4.mdx","e119609900cc3443","portfolio-4.mdx",{id:33,data:283,filePath:290,digest:291,legacyId:40,deferredRender:22},{indexHeader:284,button:285,sliderText:287,relatedProjectsText:289},"We create world-class web design, & branding",{link:138,text:286},"See more works",[288,288,288,288],"We complete client's projects efficiently","There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suf alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable.","src/content/portfolio/index.mdx","94b76e72033c8065","aboutPage",["Map",294,295,322,323,378,379,408,409,438,439,470,471,480,481,494,495,605,606,621,622],"contact-cta",{id:294,data:296,body:299,filePath:319,digest:320,legacyId:321,deferredRender:22},{header:297,subheading:298,description:299,benefits:300,contactInfo:306,responsePromise:316},"Ready to Get Started?","Get Your Finance Application Started Today","Contact Dan Peters and the Edgeview Finance team today for a confidential discussion about your business finance needs.

After spending years working across construction, manufacturing, retail, hospitality, and countless other sectors, Dan recognised that each industry has its own financial rhythms, challenges, and opportunities.\r\n\r\nThis broad exposure to hundreds of businesses and every conceivable financing scenario created something valuable - a deep understanding of how finance really works across different business models, cash flow patterns, and growth stages.\r\n\r\nWhen Dan established Edgeview Finance, he made a strategic decision. Rather than trying to be everything to everyone, he would take this extensive cross-industry experience and focus it specifically on trades businesses. Why trades? Because this sector represents some of Queensland's most dynamic and growth-oriented businesses, yet they often face unique financing challenges that generic brokers simply don't understand.\r\n\r\nToday, Dan and the Edgeview Finance team bring this wealth of experience to every trades business they work with.
