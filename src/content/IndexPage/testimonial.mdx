      title: Better interest rate than our current bank
      description: We just refinanced our home loan with Edgeview Finance and have been extremely happy with their service. We initially looked at going directly with our bank but because we own a small business, and a rural property they basically laughed at us. I called Dan, and working with him and his team nothing was too much trouble and 2 weeks later it is all approved and with a better interest rate than our current bank.
