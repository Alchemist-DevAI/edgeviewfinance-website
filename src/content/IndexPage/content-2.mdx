description: Every week you wait with the wrong or no funding strategy, may be costing you THOUSANDS in lost opportunities
points: 
    - LOST REVENUE - That $180K earthmoving contract you couldn't secure? $15,000/week bleeding away while competitors with better finance positioning win YOUR work
    - WASTED TIME - 8 weeks bouncing between banks who don't understand trades? 320 hours of your life GONE + opportunity costs mounting daily at $685+ per day
    - POOR STRUCTURING - Wrong loan terms crippling your cash flow? Interest rates 2-3% higher than necessary = $8,000+ extra per $100K annually
    - STRESS & UNCERTAINTY - Sleepless nights wondering if approval will come? Health costs, family stress, mental exhaustion - all while competitors move ahead
    - COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE - Lost 3 major contracts this quarter because you couldn't move fast enough? That's $50K+ in pure profit vanished forever
