Dan's journey into finance began with a simple observation: most finance brokers didn't truly understand the unique challenges facing different industries. After spending years working across construction, manufacturing, retail, hospitality, and countless other sectors, Dan recognised that each industry has its own financial rhythms, challenges, and opportunities.

This broad exposure to hundreds of businesses and every conceivable financing scenario created something valuable - a deep understanding of how finance really works across different business models, cash flow patterns, and growth stages.

When Dan established Edgeview Finance, he made a strategic decision. Rather than trying to be everything to everyone, he would take this extensive cross-industry experience and focus it specifically on trades businesses. Why trades? Because this sector represents some of Queensland's most dynamic and growth-oriented businesses, yet they often face unique financing challenges that generic brokers simply don't understand.

Today, Dan and the Edgeview Finance team bring this wealth of experience to every trades business they work with. Whether you need residential finance for property investment, commercial finance for equipment and expansion, or strategic advice on navigating complex funding scenarios, you benefit from insights gained across thousands of financing solutions.
