        <p>The Yatala-Stapylton Enterprise Area represents Queensland's most significant concentration of manufacturing and industrial operations. With 28% of the local workforce employed in manufacturing—nearly triple the regional average—Yatala attracts major national and international manufacturers seeking Pacific Motorway access, skilled industrial labour, and proximity to Port of Brisbane logistics networks.</p>

        <p>Major employers including Aldi's distribution centre, Carlton United Breweries' manufacturing facility, Visy Industries, Caterpillar, James Hardie, and O-I Glass manufacturing validate Yatala's position as Queensland's industrial powerhouse. The combined economic strength of the Gold Coast ($45.38 billion GRP) and Logan ($16.45 billion GRP) regions creates a robust foundation for manufacturing growth, with Yatala positioned at the centre of this $62 billion economy.</p>

        <p>Equipment finance enables manufacturers and logistics operators to acquire the heavy machinery, forklifts, production lines, and commercial vehicles essential for capitalising on Yatala's industrial expansion. With planning investigations underway (2024-2026) for revised land use strategies from 2027 onward, ongoing opportunities exist for businesses to establish or expand operations in Queensland's largest and fastest-growing industrial precinct.</p>

        <p>Yatala's strategic position on the Pacific Motorway (M1) freight corridor provides manufacturers and logistics operators with direct access to Brisbane, Gold Coast, and Port of Brisbane freight networks. This connectivity, combined with sub-2% vacancy rates for modern logistics warehouses, positions Yatala as Queensland's premier industrial location for businesses requiring efficient freight movement and distribution capabilities.</p>

        <p>Industrial property values have increased 25% over the past three years (2022-2025), with properties achieving 7.7-8% net annual yields and 9-9.6% cash-on-cash returns for investors. The Yatala-Stapylton expansion investigation (2024-2026) will deliver revised land use strategies from 2027 onward, creating ongoing opportunities for businesses to acquire affordable industrial land compared to Brisbane or southern Gold Coast locations.</p>

        <p>Equipment finance applications for Yatala manufacturers and logistics operators include:</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 24px; margin-bottom: 16px;">
