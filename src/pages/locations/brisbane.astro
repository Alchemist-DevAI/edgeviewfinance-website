        <p>Brisbane's exceptional economic performance—growing from $175 billion in 2020 to $201 billion by 2024—creates significant opportunities for trade and construction businesses across Queensland's capital. With 274,000 new jobs created in just four years and the construction sector projected to grow 41% by 2031, the region's business confidence is reflected in sustained infrastructure investment and industrial expansion.</p>

        <p>This strong economic foundation means sustained demand for commercial trades services, ongoing infrastructure projects from Cross River Rail to 2032 Olympics preparation, and growing opportunities for equipment finance and business expansion. For trade business owners, Brisbane's projected trajectory to a $275 billion economy by 2041 represents a stable, expanding market with consistent project pipelines, infrastructure contracts, and equipment financing needs across construction, manufacturing, and civil engineering sectors.</p>

        <p>The $14 billion infrastructure pipeline driven by Brisbane 2032 Olympics and Cross River Rail represents an unprecedented eight-year project timeline from 2024 to 2032. Cross River Rail alone—Queensland's largest infrastructure project—creates sustained demand for civil works contractors, earthmoving specialists, and construction businesses. Olympic venue construction, transport infrastructure upgrades, and supporting projects across Brisbane and South East Queensland generate equipment financing opportunities for businesses positioning themselves to secure contracts.</p>

        <p>Equipment finance needs for Olympics-related and Cross River Rail projects include civil works machinery for transport infrastructure, earthmoving equipment for site preparation and construction, commercial vehicles for project logistics and materials transport, and specialised equipment for rail, road, and venue construction. With Expression of Interest processes underway and contract awards continuing through 2026, Brisbane trade businesses need working capital and equipment finance to scale operations and capture contracts in this extended infrastructure boom through to 2032.</p>

        <p>Brisbane's industrial corridor from Eagle Farm in the north to Rocklea in the south represents Queensland's densest concentration of trade and manufacturing businesses. Eagle Farm's airport industrial precinct hosts aerospace manufacturing, logistics operations, and heavy equipment services. Rocklea's southern industrial estate supports transport businesses, equipment dealers, and established trade operations. The Port of Brisbane industrial area serves import/export businesses, warehousing operations, and heavy industrial equipment companies.</p>

        <p>These industrial estates support diverse sectors including manufacturing, logistics, construction equipment sales and service, automotive services, and trade supply operations. Businesses typically require equipment finance for manufacturing machinery, warehouse equipment including forklifts and material handling systems, commercial vehicles for distribution and service operations, and specialised industrial equipment. Additional industrial areas in Richlands and Darra along the western corridor continue to expand Brisbane's industrial capacity.</p>

        <p>We understand the specific finance needs of Brisbane industrial estate businesses, from manufacturing operations requiring production equipment finance to logistics companies needing warehouse fit-outs and commercial vehicle fleets. With advanced manufacturing projected to become Brisbane's leading industry by 2041, equipment finance and commercial property finance opportunities continue to expand across Queensland's capital and its premier industrial corridors.</p>
