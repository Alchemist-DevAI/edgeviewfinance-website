        <p>The Gold Coast's exceptional economic performance creates significant opportunities for trade and construction businesses. With a 3.3% unemployment rate—the lowest in Queensland—and 53,965 people employed in the construction sector alone, the region's business confidence is reflected in its 13.3% business reinvestment rate, the highest across all major Queensland regions.</p>

        <p>This strong economic foundation means sustained demand for commercial trades services, ongoing infrastructure development, and growing opportunities for equipment finance and business expansion. For trade business owners, the Gold Coast's forecast 10.07% cumulative growth through 2028 represents a stable, expanding market with consistent project pipelines and equipment financing needs.</p>

Major developments like Empire Industrial Estate—spanning 127 hectares with a $1 billion-plus economic contribution—continue to attract businesses seeking strategic positioning along the M1 Brisbane-Gold Coast corridor.</p>

        <p>Yatala-based businesses typically require equipment finance for manufacturing machinery, warehouse equipment including forklifts and material handling systems, commercial vehicles for distribution operations, and specialised industrial equipment. The estate's 24/7 operations and strategic transport links make it ideal for logistics and manufacturing businesses requiring substantial equipment investment.</p>

        <p>We understand the specific needs of Yatala Enterprise Area businesses, from food processing manufacturers requiring production equipment finance to logistics operations needing warehouse fit-outs and commercial vehicle fleets. With the industrial estate forecast to employ over 20,000 people within five years, equipment finance and commercial property finance opportunities continue to expand across Queensland's premier industrial hub.</p>
