        Equipment Finance for Brisbane North - Brendale Industrial Hub
      </h1>

      <div class="intro-text">
        <p>Brendale Industrial Estate is Queensland's manufacturing powerhouse. With 2,024 registered businesses concentrated in just 17.9 square kilometres, this premier industrial precinct north of Brisbane is home to major manufacturers including Woolworths distribution, Coca-Cola beverage production, and automotive parts companies (Moreton Bay Council Industry Plan, 2024).</p>

        <p>But there's a challenge facing Brisbane North manufacturers today. Industrial land in Brendale trades at $466 per square metre, with only 150 hectares remaining—less than two years' supply at current absorption rates (Cushman & Wakefield, May 2025). A recent 49,380 square metre industrial block sold for $23 million, demonstrating the fierce competition for scarce space.</p>

        <p>When expansion through land acquisition isn't viable, smart manufacturers turn to equipment finance. Upgrading production machinery, investing in automation, and modernising warehouse infrastructure allows Brisbane North businesses to grow their operations without the prohibitive cost of relocation. Edgeview Finance understands the unique pressures facing Brendale's industrial sector and provides flexible equipment financing solutions tailored to manufacturing, distribution, and logistics businesses.</p>

      <div class="context-text">
        <p>Located 20 kilometres north of Brisbane's CBD, Brendale Industrial Estate represents one of South East Queensland's most concentrated business hubs. The area's 2,024 registered businesses generate significant economic activity, with 75.3% classified as small to medium enterprises employing between one and 19 staff (BNE McGees, 2024).</p>

        <p>Manufacturing drives Brendale's economy. An impressive 14.3% of the workforce is employed in manufacturing—a specialisation ratio of 4.02 compared to Brisbane's average. Construction companies represent 18% of businesses, while manufacturing accounts for 11.4%, creating a robust industrial ecosystem where equipment finance demands are consistently high.</p>

        <p>The precinct's strategic location provides Brisbane North manufacturers with exceptional transport access. Bruce Highway frontage delivers seamless north-south connectivity, while Gateway Motorway access links businesses to the Port of Brisbane and Gold Coast markets. This positioning has attracted major corporate tenants, including Woolworths' regional distribution centre and Coca-Cola's Queensland beverage manufacturing facility, establishing competitive standards that drive equipment modernisation across the entire industrial corridor.</p>

      <div class="context-text">
        <p>The industrial land shortage in Brendale has created a fundamental challenge for growing manufacturers. With raw land now trading at $466 per square metre and completed industrial lots reaching $750-$950 per square metre, the traditional expansion model—acquiring adjacent property—has become economically unviable for most SMEs. Industry analysts note that only 150 hectares of active industrial land remain in core Brisbane North precincts, representing less than two years' supply (Property Council Australia, 2025).</p>

        <p>This land constraint has accelerated a shift toward capital investment in equipment rather than real estate. Manufacturing businesses are prioritising production efficiency through advanced machinery, warehouse automation through modern material handling equipment, and logistics optimisation through fleet modernisation. Equipment finance provides the funding mechanism that enables this strategic pivot.</p>

        <p>The presence of major corporate tenants further intensifies this dynamic. When Woolworths operates a state-of-the-art distribution centre and Coca-Cola runs an advanced beverage manufacturing facility in your industrial precinct, competitive pressure to maintain operational excellence becomes unavoidable. Smaller manufacturers and distributors serving these supply chains require contemporary equipment to meet quality standards, delivery timeframes, and cost structures that align with large corporate expectations.</p>

        <p>This is where equipment finance delivers strategic value for Brisbane North's industrial businesses.</p>
