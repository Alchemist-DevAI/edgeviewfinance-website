      <h2>Business Finance on the Sunshine Coast</h2>

      <p class="section-intro">The Sunshine Coast economy is experiencing unprecedented growth, creating exceptional opportunities for trade and service businesses across the region. With major infrastructure investments transforming the commercial landscape, the need for strategic business finance has never been greater.</p>

        <p>This economic transformation positions the Sunshine Coast as Queensland's premier growth region outside Brisbane. Trade businesses and healthcare services need agile business finance to capture market share during this infrastructure boom. Traditional banks often struggle to understand coastal market dynamics—Edgeview Finance doesn't.</p>

  <!-- Section 3: Unique Opportunity -->
  <section class="opportunity-section">
    <div class="opportunity-content">
      <h2>Sunshine Coast's Healthcare Boom & Coastal Construction Expertise</h2>

      <p>Two sectors dominate Sunshine Coast business finance demand: healthcare infrastructure and coastal construction. Both industries require specialised finance solutions that account for regional growth patterns and environmental challenges.</p>

      <h3>Healthcare Equipment Finance</h3>
      <p>The $5 billion Sunshine Coast Health Precinct transformation creates unprecedented demand for medical equipment finance. General practices are expanding to accommodate population growth. Allied health providers need diagnostic equipment, physiotherapy tools, and practice fitout finance. Dental surgeries require technology upgrades to compete in a growing market. Aged care facilities need specialised medical equipment for expanding capacity.</p>

      <p>Medical equipment finance on the Sunshine Coast differs from metropolitan markets. Practices often need faster deployment to capture market share in new residential areas. Equipment purchases must anticipate population growth—the region's healthcare demand is projected to increase 35% by 2030. Finance terms need flexibility for practices balancing expansion with uncertain patient volumes in developing suburbs.</p>

      <h3>Coastal Construction & Trades Specialisation</h3>
      <p>Construction represents 21.5% of Sunshine Coast businesses—significantly higher than Queensland's 17.0% average. The Maroochydore CBD development alone creates years of commercial construction work, from groundworks to fitout specialists. However, coastal construction demands specialised equipment finance solutions.</p>

      <HighlightBox
        number="⚙️"
        title="Coastal Equipment Finance Specialists"
        items={highlightItems}
      />

      <p>Marine-grade equipment resists salt corrosion better than standard machinery, essential for coastal construction projects. Excavators, trucks, and tools require protective coatings and corrosion-resistant materials. Finance terms must account for higher equipment costs and specialised maintenance requirements. Traditional lenders often don't understand why coastal equipment costs 15-20% more than Brisbane equivalents—Edgeview Finance does.</p>

      <p>Trades businesses face similar challenges. Electricians need marine-grade conduit and fittings. Plumbers require corrosion-resistant pipes and fixtures. HVAC specialists need equipment rated for high-humidity coastal environments. Equipment finance for Sunshine Coast trades isn't just about purchasing machinery—it's about investing in assets that withstand Queensland's coastal conditions.</p>

      <div class="geographic-descriptions">
        <h3>Maroochydore City Centre: 60 Hectares</h3>
        <p>Australia's newest greenfield CBD spans 60 hectares of prime coastal real estate. The $2.5 billion private investment includes 160,000 square metres of commercial and retail space, underground automated waste collection, WiFi-6 infrastructure, and the fastest data connectivity on Australia's east coast. Businesses relocating to Maroochydore require commercial property finance for office acquisition, fitout finance for 5 Star Green Star premises, and working capital for relocation logistics. The CBD creates opportunities for professional services, medical practices, and technology businesses requiring premium commercial space.</p>

        <h3>Caloundra: South Coast Business Hub</h3>
        <p>Caloundra serves as the Sunshine Coast's southern commercial gateway, with strong marine industry presence and growing commercial developments. The precinct attracts trade businesses servicing coastal developments, marine service providers, and healthcare practices serving the southern corridor to Brisbane. Commercial property values remain below Maroochydore levels, creating acquisition opportunities for businesses seeking coastal locations with Brisbane connectivity. Finance requirements include commercial property loans for business premises, equipment finance for marine trades, and working capital for inventory-dependent businesses.</p>

        <h3>Industrial Precincts: Manufacturing & Logistics</h3>
        <p>Sippy Downs and Coolum Industrial Estate provide manufacturing and logistics capacity for the region. These precincts house construction suppliers, trade warehouses, and manufacturing businesses servicing coastal development. Finance needs include warehouse acquisition loans, fitout finance for industrial premises, equipment finance for manufacturing machinery, and working capital for inventory management. Industrial property prices have increased 40% since 2020, driven by Brisbane's industrial land scarcity and Sunshine Coast population growth.</p>

        <p>Each geographic zone presents distinct business finance opportunities. Edgeview Finance structures loan packages that account for location-specific market dynamics, from CBD premium positioning to industrial precinct cashflow patterns.</p>
