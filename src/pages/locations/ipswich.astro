        <p>Ipswich is experiencing unprecedented economic expansion, outpacing all other south-east Queensland councils and nearly doubling the state average growth rate. The region's economy achieved a record $15.08 billion gross regional product in 2024, representing 4.2% annual growth—significantly higher than Queensland's 2.9% average and outperforming major centres like Gold Coast (1.96%) and Logan (2.6%).</p>

        <p>This robust economic performance has created 95,532 local jobs, surpassing the council's 2027 employment target three years ahead of schedule. With 13,049 registered businesses operating across the region, Ipswich's business landscape is dominated by micro and small enterprises in manufacturing, construction, transport, and professional services.</p>

        <p>Recent job growth has been strongest in construction (+793 jobs), manufacturing (+516 jobs), and transport and warehousing (+504 jobs)—all sectors requiring significant equipment investment and working capital. The region's manufacturing sector alone generates $2.7 billion in annual exports, whilst major infrastructure projects including Inland Rail, the $1.5 billion Ripley Town Centre, and $700 million hospital expansion are driving unprecedented demand for business finance across construction, logistics, and support services.</p>
