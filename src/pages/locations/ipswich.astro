This robust economic performance has created <strong>95,532 local jobs</strong>, surpassing the council's 2027 employment target three years ahead of schedule.</p>

        <p>With <strong>13,049 registered businesses</strong> operating across the region, Ipswich's business landscape is dominated by micro and small enterprises in manufacturing, construction, transport, and professional services. Recent job growth has been strongest in construction (+793 jobs), manufacturing (+516 jobs), and transport and warehousing (+504 jobs)—all sectors requiring significant equipment investment and working capital.</p>

        <p>The region's <strong>manufacturing sector alone generates $2.7 billion in annual exports</strong>, whilst major infrastructure projects including Inland Rail, the $1.5 billion Ripley Town Centre, and $700 million hospital expansion are driving unprecedented demand for business finance across construction, logistics, and support services.</p>
